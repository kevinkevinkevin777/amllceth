 <b><p style="color:white">Web3 Manifesto</p></b>
 
<p style="color:white">Web3 is a primarily a social movement.</p> 
 
<p style="color:white">Web3 is a revolution.</p>
 
 <p style="color:white">Now we have technology that empowers users to fully control their data, control their privacy, and control their money.</p>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 allows users of the internet to become sovereign citizens of the internet. The power thus returns to the people.</p>
 
  <p style="color:white">This is where the power always was, but people have lost sight of this.</p>
 
  <p style="color:white">***</p>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 is not just new technology.</p>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 is a new way of thinking.</p>
 
<p style="color:white">Web3 has a purpose, and that purpose is to change our lived reality to something that is better than our current timeline. </p>
 
<p style="color:white">More specifically, the purpose of web3 is to return control of the internet back to the users of the internet. </p>
 
  <p style="color:white">The purpose of web3 is to also cause positive social change. This must always be at the root of web3.</P> 
   
   <p style="color:white">If web3 becomes nothing more than a flashy version of web2, we will have failed.</p> 
 
 <p style="color:white">***</p>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 is by idealists, for idealists.</b>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 rejects division and partisanship.</b>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 rejects destruction, accellerationism, and nihilism. We wish to build and not destroy</b>
 
 <p style="color:white">Web3 rejects racism, sexism, ableism, classism, imperialism, and every other form of oppression.</b>
 

 <p style="color:white">Web3 is what you say it is. Do not let others tell you what web3 is. This manifesto is just one opinion out of many. </p>
 
<p style="color:white">To be continued. Spelling errors are my fault. </b>
